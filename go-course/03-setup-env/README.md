# üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Go Development Environment

This module will guide you through **installing Go, setting up your workspace, and configuring your development environment** so you can start building Go programs efficiently.

## üß© Step 1: Install Go

### Linux / Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y golang
```
Verify installation:
```
go version
```
Expected Output Example:
```
go version go1.21 linux/amd64
```
macOS

Using Homebrew:
```
brew install go
```
Verify:
```
go version
```
Windows

Download the Go installer from https://go.dev/dl/.
Run the installer and follow instructions.
Verify in PowerShell or CMD:
```
go version
```
## üß© Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables
Linux / macOS

Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```
Apply changes:
```
source ~/.bashrc   # or source ~/.zshrc
```
Verify:
```
echo $GOPATH
```
Expected Output Example:
```
/home/username/go
```
Windows

Set GOPATH as a system environment variable (e.g., C:\Users\<YourUser>\go).

Add %GOPATH%\bin and Go installation path (C:\Go\bin) to the system PATH.

Restart terminal and verify:
```
go env GOPATH
```
## üß© Step 3: Create a Go Workspace
Create directories for Go workspace:
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src
mkdir -p $GOPATH/bin
mkdir -p $GOPATH/pkg
```
Workspace Structure:
```
go-workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/       # Compiled binaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pkg/       # Packages
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/       # Source code
```
## üß© Step 4: Configure VS Code for Go
Install Visual Studio Code.

Install Go extension by Microsoft.

Open any Go file ‚Üí VS Code will prompt to install Go tools (gopls, goimports, etc.) ‚Üí Install them.

Set the workspace folder to your Go project directory.

## üß© Step 5: Verify the Setup
Create a file main.go in your workspace:
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Go environment is ready!")
}
```
Run the program:
```
go run main.go
```
Expected Output:
```
Go environment is ready!
```
Compile to Binary (Optional)
```
go build main.go
./main   # Run the compiled binary
```
