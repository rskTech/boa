# Lesson 01 — Introduction to Go Programming

## Objectives
- Understand what Go is and where it's used
- Create and run your first Go program
- Learn basic compilation and workspace concepts

### What is Go (detailed)
Go is an open-source, statically typed, compiled language created at Google. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, concurrency, and tooling.

### Differences vs other languages
- Go vs Python: compiled, statically typed vs interpreted, dynamically typed.
- Go vs Java: single binary, simpler deployment vs JVM.
- Go vs C/C++: garbage-collected and safer; less low-level control.


## Examples
- `code/example1.go` — Hello World with timestamp
- `code/example2.go` — Command-line args example
