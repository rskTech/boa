# Lesson 05 — Data Structures (Arrays, Slices, Maps, Structs)

## Data Structures
- Arrays fixed size; slices are dynamic views; maps are key-value; structs are composite types with methods.
- Performance notes: slicing creates small descriptors; maps need sync for concurrent writes.


## Examples
- `code/example1.go` — Slices append and copy
- `code/example2.go` — Maps and structs

See `exercises.md` for tasks and hints.
