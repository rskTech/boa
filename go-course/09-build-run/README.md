# Lesson 09 — Building and Running Go Programs

## Build & Run
- `go run` for dev; `go build` to create binaries; cross-compile with GOOS/GOARCH.
- Use `-ldflags "-s -w"` to strip debug info and reduce size.


## Examples
- `code/example1.go` — Simple build example
- `code/example2.go` — Cross-compile command example

See `exercises.md` for tasks and hints.
